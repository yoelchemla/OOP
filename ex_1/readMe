This interface represents an undirectional weighted graph.
  It should support a large number of 
  nodes (over 10^6, with average degree of 10).
  The implementation should be based on an 
  efficient compact representation
  (should NOT be based on a n*n matrix).

 The interface weighted_graph_algorithms represents an Undirected (positive) Weighted 
 Graph Theory algorithms including:
 * 0. clone(); (copy)
 * 1. init(graph);
 * 2. isConnected();
 * 3. double shortestPathDist(int src, int dest);
 * 4. List<node_data> shortestPath(int src, int dest);
 * 5. Save(file);
 * 6. Load(file);
 						* **the specific explain exists in the methods!!
